# backpack.tf Killstreak Kit Additions

An userscript that adds some functionality to backpack.tf to aid navigation when checking stats for killstreak weapons, kits and fabricators. 
* On a given weapon's stats page, it adds shortcuts to different killstreak tiers of the same weapon, and a link to the killstreak kit stats if it has one;
* On a given kit's stats page, it also adds shortcuts to its different tiers, shortcuts to all the weapon variants it can be applied to, and a link to its fabricator;
